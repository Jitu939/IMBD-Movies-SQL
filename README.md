# IMBD-Movies-SQL.
## 🔍 Analysis Deep-Dive

The project solves 13 specific business questions using SQL. Highlights include:

* **Director Insights:** Identified specific directors (James Cameron, etc.), filtered by gender, and calculated who has the highest "bankable" (revenue) value.
* **Performance Metrics:** Ranked movies by popularity and revenue using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.
* **Data Aggregation:** Used `JOIN` and `GROUP BY` to link the Directors and Movies tables to find the most prolific filmmakers.
* **Temporal Filtering:** Analyzed movie ratings specifically for films released in the 21st century (post-2000).
